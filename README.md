# car-dekho-ml-project
This project is about predicting used car prices using the CarDekho dataset and basic machine learning techniques. The idea is to understand how different factors like the car’s year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine size, and ownership affect its price. 
The project follows a classical end-to-end ML workflow:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature encoding and selection

Model training using Linear Regression

Model evaluation and performance analysis
