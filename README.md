# car-dekho-ml-project
This project is about predicting used car prices using the CarDekho dataset and basic machine learning techniques. The idea is to understand how different factors like the car’s year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine size, and ownership affect its price. 

The project follows a classical end-to-end ML workflow:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature encoding and selection
Model training using Linear Regression
Model evaluation and performance analysis

The core implementation is provided as a Jupyter Notebook, which serves as the foundation for the project.
The Streamlit web application is created using this notebook, turning the trained model into an interactive and user-friendly interface.

This project is designed to demonstrate strong fundamentals in regression, data handling, and practical machine learning problem-solving, with an emphasis on clarity, structure, and explainability.
